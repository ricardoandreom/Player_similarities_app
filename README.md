# Football Player Similarity app
This project is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to find football players who are most similar to a chosen player.
The backend of the application extracts data from FBref, processes it, and computes the cosine similarity between players to suggest the closest matches.

## Overview
The Football Player Similarity finder leverages data extracted from FBref, a comprehensive source for football statistics, to calculate and compare the similarity between players. 
The similarity is determined using cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional spaceâ€”where each vector represents a player's statistical profile.

## Features
**Player Data Extraction:** Automatically extracts and preprocesses player data from FBref.

**Cosine Similarity Model:** Computes the cosine similarity between players' statistical profiles.

**Interactive Interface:** Allows users to select a player from a list and view a ranked list of the most similar players.

**Percentage Similarity:** Displays how similar each suggested player is to the selected player.
